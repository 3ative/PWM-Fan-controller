# ESPHome Automatic 4-Wire PWM (5-24v) Fan controller with Alarm.

Using a DALLAS temperature sensor and a threshold Slider, the speed of the Fan is automatically controlled from 0 to 100%. Making it ideal for ventilating / cooling your projects. I.E. Holiday Lights controller enclosure, Media Cabinet units and many more.


- With an on-board regulator to power the D1 Mini, this project is ready to control 5,12 or 24 Volt fans without modification
- (just make sure you power this project with the same voltage your fan uses).
