# ESPHome Automatic 4-Wire PWM (5-24v) Fan controller with Alarm.

Using a DALLAS temperature sensor and a threshold Slider, the speed of the Fan is automatically controlled from 0 to 100%. Making it ideal for ventilating / cooling your projects. I.E. Holiday Lights controller enclosure, Media Cabinet units and many more.


- With an on-board regulator to power the D1 Mini, this project is ready to control 5,12 or 24 Volt fans without modification
- (just make sure you power this project with the same voltage your fan uses).

## ESPHome 2024.6.x Update notice:
If you are having problems with board resetting or DALLAS temperature after adding the ``one_wire:`` Breaking Change. [ssieb](https://github.com/ssieb) has got a fix for you.
Please add this External Component to your YAML:
```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/ssieb/esphome
      ref: onewire
    components: [ gpio ]
    refresh: 1min
```
 - I have also added it to the Yaml Files
